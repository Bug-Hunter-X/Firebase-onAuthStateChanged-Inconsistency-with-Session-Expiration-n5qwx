The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger if the user's session expires or is invalidated due to a backend change (e.g., password reset, account deletion). This can lead to unexpected behavior where the app remains logged in despite the user no longer having a valid session.  The symptom is often that the user interface continues to reflect the logged-in state, even though network requests that depend on authentication fail.
